# Detection-of-Fraud
This notebook looks into using various python based machine leaning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company.

We're going to take the following approach:

Experimentation

1. Problem Defination

In a statement,

Give financial data about the company, can we predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company and develop an actionable plan?

2. Data

Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns which you can access through the drive link :

3. Evaluation

We will evaluate our project on the fact that iff we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a transaction made is a fraudulent one during the proof of concept.

Features, Modelling and Experimentation is shown in the notebook!
